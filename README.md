# epileptic_seizures_detection_prediction-NN
Creation of classifiers using neural networks in MATLAB for the prediction and detection of epileptic seizures episodes.

Project developed for the "Neural computations and fuzzy systems". This project aimed to familiarize students with neural networks architectures, recurrent and feedforward. The results weren't ideal mainly due to the available data but the goal of the assignment was achieved.
